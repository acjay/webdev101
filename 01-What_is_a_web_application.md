# What is a web application?

Before we get into the technology itself, I think it's important that we start with a question that might seem a little bit basic:

> What is a web application?

I hope you'll indulge me a bit, because I believe this will help give us a bit of a perspective for what we're trying to accomplish when we build these things.

I think of a web application as an experience that a user interacts with in a web browser. It has two basic goals: 

1. Show content to the user.
2. Accept information from the user.

That's really it!

Of course, web applications can do more than this. But these are the basics. In my mind, a web application builds on the earlier concept of a _website_ by accepting a significant amount of user input and generally being dynamic, in the sense of a user's input affecting what that user or other users will see later. So, a web application is interactive, and it probably stores information. Related to this is the idea of a website with _user-generated content_. Back around Y2K, Darcy DiNucci coined the term [Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0) to identify this trend of increasing interactivity. I hope that this maybe ties some threads you may have heard together in a neat bundle.

Usually, a web application communicates with one or more web services running remotely on other physical computers. This is one major difference between web applications and the pre-Internet desktop applications. We'll dig into how and why this is as the series progresses.

Lastly, I want to be clear that when I talk about web applications, I'm really talking about user experiences. Under the hood, there may be lots o different systems and services involved, but from the user's perspective, a well designed web application is just one cohesive. My goal is that by the end of the series, you'll have an understanding of how web developers knit multiple systems together to produce a typical web application.
